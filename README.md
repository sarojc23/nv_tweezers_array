## nv_tweezers_array

A Python-based control and analysis toolkit for generating SLM-based optical tweezers arrays to target and read out nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond for parallel quantum sensing and imaging applications.

### Overview

This repository enables:
- Generation of custom tweezer arrays using a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM)
- Targeting and weight assignment for NV centers based on spatial coordinates or signal intensity
- Calibration and alignment of optical patterns to match NV array positions
- Integration with EMCCD cameras and hardware control pipelines
